/* We need to create a function that chooses 1 string randomly between 3 strings and returns it.

Create a variable computerChoice
Create function getComputerChoice
    Create a variable randomNumber that will receive a random number between 0 and 2
    If randomNumber is 0, then computerChoice gets the value "rock"
    Else if randomNumber is 1, then computerChoice gets the value "paper"
    Else if randomNumber is 2, then computerChoice gets the value "scissors"
    The function returns computerChoice
